## HTML Elements You'll Use

- **`<ul>`**: Unordered list (for ingredients - order doesn't matter)
- **`<ol>`**: Ordered list (for cooking steps - sequence matters)  
- **`<li>`**: List item (individual items in both ul and ol)
- **`<dl>`**: Description list (for detailed step explanations)
- **`<dt>`**: Description term (step titles)
- **`<dd>`**: Description definition (step details)

---

## Success Tips

**Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Start with ingredients**: Convert plain text to `<ul>` with `<li>` elements
2. **Structure the process**: Wrap all steps in `<ol>`
3. **Add step containers**: Put each step in its own `<li>`
4. **Implement descriptions**: Use `<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>` inside each step


**Key Rules:**
- Use `<ul>` when order doesn't matter (ingredients)
- Use `<ol>` when sequence is important (cooking steps)
- Maintain proper nesting: `ol > li > dl > dt/dd`
