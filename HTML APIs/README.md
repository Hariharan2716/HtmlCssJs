## HTML Geolocation

- The **HTML Geolocation** is used to get the geographical position of a user.  Due to privacy concerns, this position requires user approval.  Geo-location in HTML5 is used to share the location with some websites and be aware of the exact loaction.  It is mainly used for loaction businesses, and restaurants, or showing locations on the map.  It uses JavaScript to give lattitude and longitude to the backend server.

- Most browsers support Geolocation API.  Geo-location API uses a global navigator object.

`Syntax:`
`var loc = navigator.geolocation`
